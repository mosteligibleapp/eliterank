/**
 * usePerformanceDashboard
 *
 * Builds the contestant-facing "performance" view: for every competition the
 * user entered (any status except removed), it returns their lifetime vote
 * total broken down into free / paid / bonus, how far they advanced (named
 * rounds, e.g. "Entry Round" / "Top 50" / "Finale"), and the roster of
 * contestants they competed against.
 *
 * Vote breakdown comes straight from the never-reset lifetime_* counters on
 * `contestants` (migration 054), so the numbers reflect the whole competition
 * rather than just the current round.
 *
 * Returns an array, one entry per competition, shaped:
 *   {
 *     competitionId, competitionName, citySeason, orgName, orgLogo,
 *     orgSlug, competitionSlug, competitionStatus,
 *     myContestantId, myStatus, placement, fieldSize,
 *     roundsReached, totalRounds, rounds: [{ order, label }],
 *     totalVotes, freeVotes, paidVotes, bonusVotes,
 *     competitors: [
 *       { id, name, avatarUrl, city, status, votes }
 *     ]
 *   }
