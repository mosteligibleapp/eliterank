/**
 * ContestTermsPage - Contest Terms & Conditions
 *
 * Structured as a contest of skill (pageant model). Each competition publishes
 * its own scoring formula (judges, weighted public support, or both); the
 * Host identified on the contest page is responsible for that competition.
 *
 * Intentionally does NOT include sweepstakes / AMOE / "no purchase necessary"
 * language because the platform awards prizes only to contestants and only on
 * the basis of the published scoring criteria. Voters do not enter any drawing
 * and do not receive prizes. If a voter-drawing feature is added later, the
 * sweepstakes framework will need to be re-added.

          <p style={styles.p}>
            EliteRank, operated by <span style={styles.strong}>Most Eligible LLC</span>, an Illinois limited
            liability company ("EliteRank," "we," "us"), offers online recognition competitions in which individuals
            may be nominated, entered as contestants, voted on by the public and by judges, and awarded prizes.
          </p>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            By entering, participating, voting, or otherwise taking part in any competition offered through
            eliterank.co (the "Platform"), you ("Entrant," "Voter," or "Participant," as applicable) agree to be
            bound by these Contest Terms &amp; Conditions (the "Contest Terms"), our{' '}

            Additional Rules are incorporated into these Contest Terms by reference. If there is a conflict between
            these Contest Terms and Additional Rules on the contest page, the Additional Rules control with respect
            to the affected competition.
          </p>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            All decisions of the Host (defined below) and of EliteRank in administering a competition are final
            and binding in all respects and are not subject to appeal, except where applicable law provides
            otherwise. Any violation of these Contest Terms may, in the Host's sole discretion, result in
            disqualification.

          <h2 style={styles.h2}>2. Host and Promotion Entities</h2>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            Each competition has a designated <span style={styles.strong}>Host</span>, identified on the relevant
            contest page. The Host is the organization responsible for the competition, including selecting
            winners, awarding prizes, and complying with applicable law. EliteRank acts as the platform provider and
            administrator unless explicitly identified as the Host.
          </p>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            "Promotion Entities" means the Host, EliteRank, their respective affiliates, and their officers,
            directors, employees, agents, contractors, judges, and sponsors of the competition.
          </p>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            <span style={styles.strong}>Host responsibility for legal compliance.</span> The Host &mdash; not
            EliteRank &mdash; is solely responsible for the lawful design, promotion, and conduct of the
            competition, including without limitation compliance with all sweepstakes, contest, lottery, gaming,
            raffle, charitable-solicitation, consumer-protection, advertising, prize-disclosure, taxation,
            data-protection, privacy, intellectual-property, and labor laws and regulations of every jurisdiction
            in which the competition is offered, promoted, conducted, or capable of being entered, at the
            country, federal, national, state, provincial, territorial, county, parish, municipal, city,
            township, tribal, or other governmental level. The Host is solely responsible for any required
            registration, bonding, permitting, licensing, filing, tax withholding, or disclosure, and for the
            consequences of any failure to obtain or comply with the same.
          </p>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            <span style={styles.strong}>No legal advice from EliteRank.</span> EliteRank acts only as a neutral
            technology platform and administrator and does not provide legal, tax, or regulatory advice. The Host
            should consult qualified counsel in each relevant jurisdiction before launching, promoting, or
            conducting any competition.
          </p>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            <span style={styles.strong}>Host indemnification of EliteRank.</span> The Host shall defend,
            indemnify, and hold EliteRank and its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors,
            employees, agents, licensors, and service providers, harmless from and against any claim, demand,
            investigation, regulatory action, penalty, fine, tax, judgment, settlement, loss, cost, or expense
            (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to the Host's competition or any
            failure of the Host (or any person acting under the Host's direction or on its behalf, including
            judges, sponsors, and co-promoters selected by the Host) to comply with any applicable law in any
            jurisdiction. This obligation is in addition to, and incorporates, the Host indemnification set out
            in Section 13 of the EliteRank Terms of Use.

          <h2 style={styles.h2}>3. Eligibility</h2>
          <p style={styles.p}>To enter or vote in a competition, you must:</p>
          <ul style={styles.ul}>
            <li style={styles.li}>be at least <span style={styles.strong}>18 years of age</span> (or the age of majority in your state or province, whichever is greater) at the time of entry;</li>
            <li style={styles.li}>be a legal resident of the <span style={styles.strong}>United States</span> (the 50 states and the District of Columbia) or the <span style={styles.strong}>province of Ontario, Canada</span>; and</li>

          </ul>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            Employees, officers, directors, and contractors of the Host and of the other Promotion Entities, and
            their immediate family members (spouse, parents, siblings, children) and members of their households,
            are not eligible to win prizes in any competition they administer.
          </p>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            Each contest page identifies the specific eligibility, age, and geographic requirements for that
            competition (for example, a city or regional restriction). It is your responsibility to verify your
            eligibility before entering or voting.

          <h2 style={styles.h2}>4. How to Enter</h2>

          <h3 style={styles.h3}>4.1 Nominations and Entries</h3>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            Each competition will specify on the contest page how individuals may be nominated and how a nomination
            becomes an entry (a "Contestant"). Typically, an individual may self-nominate or be nominated by a third
            party. A nominated individual must accept the nomination, complete the required profile information,
            and agree to these Contest Terms to become a Contestant.
          </p>

          <h3 style={styles.h3}>4.2 Submitted Materials</h3>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            "Submitted Materials" means photos, videos, captions, bios, social handles, and any other content you
            submit as part of an entry, profile, or bonus task. Submitted Materials must:
          </p>
          <ul style={styles.ul}>
            <li style={styles.li}>be your original work or content you have the right to submit;</li>
            <li style={styles.li}>not infringe the intellectual-property, privacy, publicity, or other rights of any third party;</li>
            <li style={styles.li}>not contain content that is obscene, sexually explicit involving minors, defamatory, hateful, threatening, or otherwise illegal;</li>
            <li style={styles.li}>comply with the Additional Rules for the competition and any platform community guidelines.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 style={styles.h3}>4.3 Consent of Others</h3>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            If your Submitted Materials depict or identify any other person, you represent that you have obtained
            that person's prior written consent to (a) the submission and (b) the use of the materials by the
            Promotion Entities as described in these Contest Terms.
          </p>

          <h3 style={styles.h3}>4.4 Ownership and License</h3>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            You retain ownership of your Submitted Materials. By submitting them, you grant the Promotion Entities a
            non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, perpetual license to use, host, store, copy,
            reproduce, display, perform, publish, distribute, translate, adapt, and create derivative works of your
            Submitted Materials in any media (now known or later developed) for purposes of administering, promoting,
            and operating the competition, the Platform, and related marketing.

        <section style={styles.section}>
          <h2 style={styles.h2}>5. Contest of Skill: Format and Selection of Winners</h2>
          <div style={styles.callout}>
            <p style={{ ...styles.p, marginBottom: 0 }}>
              Each competition on the Platform is structured as a <span style={styles.strong}>contest of skill</span>.
              Winners are determined by published criteria evaluated by qualified judges and/or by an aggregated
              measure of public support, as specified on the contest page. No prize is awarded by random drawing.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 style={styles.h3}>5.1 Competition Rounds</h3>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            A competition may consist of one or more rounds, including a nomination round, contestant round,
            preliminary judging round, public-support round(s), final round, and/or a winner-announcement event.
            The structure, dates, and scoring formula for each competition are published on the contest page.
          </p>

          <h3 style={styles.h3}>5.2 Scoring Formula</h3>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            The Host publishes the scoring formula for each competition on the contest page. The formula may
            include judge scoring on stated criteria (such as talent, presentation, community impact, or other
            attributes), aggregated public support measured through the Platform's voting feature, bonus-task
            completion, or any combination of these. Where multiple inputs are used, the contest page identifies
            the weighting that applies.
          </p>

          <h3 style={styles.h3}>5.3 Judging</h3>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            Where the competition includes judges, the Host selects judges qualified to evaluate contestants
            against the published criteria. Judges' scores are recorded on the Platform and, where applicable,
            combined with other scoring inputs in accordance with the published formula. Judges' decisions, and the
            Host's final tally, are final and binding.
          </p>

          <h3 style={styles.h3}>5.4 Public Support / Voting</h3>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            Where the competition includes a public-support component, voters may show support by casting votes for
            a contestant. Each voter receives at least one free vote credit per competition; voters may also
            purchase additional vote credits through the Platform's payment processor (Stripe). Votes are recorded
            in the contestant's tally and, where the contest page so specifies, factor into the contestant's final
            score under the published scoring formula.
          </p>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            Votes are a measure of public support for a contestant and are <span style={styles.strong}>not</span>{' '}
            entries in any drawing. Voters do not receive any prize, reward, or chance of winning by voting, and
            purchasing votes does not entitle the voter to anything other than additional voting capacity. Votes
            purchased through the Platform are final and non-refundable once recorded, except as required by law or
            as expressly provided on the contest page.
          </p>

          <h3 style={styles.h3}>5.5 Prohibited Voting and Fraud</h3>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            To protect competitive integrity, the following are prohibited and will result in disqualification of
            the affected contestant and/or suspension or banning of the affected voter:
          </p>
          <ul style={styles.ul}>
            <li style={styles.li}>votes generated by automated means (bots, scripts) or through fraudulent payment instruments;</li>
            <li style={styles.li}>votes followed by chargebacks, refunds, or payment reversals;</li>
            <li style={styles.li}>votes cast through multiple accounts, false identities, or other circumvention of one-person-one-account controls;</li>
            <li style={styles.li}>coordinated vote-buying outside the Platform's official vote-purchase flow;</li>
            <li style={styles.li}><span style={styles.strong}>self-purchase of votes by a contestant for their own entry</span> &mdash; contestants may not purchase votes for themselves, whether directly, through an account or payment method they control, or through their immediate family members, household members, employees, contractors, or anyone acting at their direction or with their funding;</li>
            <li style={styles.li}>any other manner of casting or acquiring votes not expressly permitted by these Contest Terms.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            EliteRank and the Host may, at their sole discretion and without notice, void votes, reverse rankings,
            withhold prizes, suspend accounts, and disqualify contestants found to have benefited from any prohibited
            activity. Detection methods include payment-instrument matching, device fingerprinting, account linkage
            analysis, and review of Stripe receipts.
          </p>

        <section style={styles.section}>
          <h2 style={styles.h2}>6. Prizes</h2>
          <ul style={styles.ul}>
            <li style={styles.li}>Prizes are as described in the Additional Rules on the contest page. Winners may be featured on the Platform and in related marketing materials.</li>
            <li style={styles.li}>Prizes are not transferable, assignable, or for resale, and have no cash equivalent unless explicitly stated. The Host reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to substitute a prize or any component of a prize with one of equal or greater retail value (or with a cash equivalent) without liability if the original prize becomes unavailable.</li>
            <li style={styles.li}>Prizes will be distributed to winners as soon as practical after winner verification (typically within two to six months). Delays may occur where scheduling with celebrities, sponsors, or third parties is required.</li>
            <li style={styles.li}>The Host is responsible only for its portion of any prize and is not liable for any portion of a prize provided (or not provided) by a third party.</li>
            <li style={styles.li}><span style={styles.strong}>Taxes:</span> All federal, state, and local taxes, withholdings, and other charges associated with the receipt or use of a prize are the sole responsibility of the winner. Where the retail value of a prize requires it (currently $600 or more in aggregate per calendar year for U.S. recipients), the Host will issue an IRS Form 1099-MISC or 1099-NEC to the winner and will require the winner to provide a completed IRS Form W-9 (or equivalent) before the prize is released.</li>
            <li style={styles.li}>The Promotion Entities are not liable for any injury, loss, or damages that may result from acceptance or use of a prize, and are not liable for any shipping delays.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section style={styles.section}>
          <h2 style={styles.h2}>7. Charity Allocation (When Applicable)</h2>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            Some competitions designate a charitable beneficiary on the contest page. Where a charitable allocation
            is designated, up to twenty percent (20%) of net proceeds from purchased votes for that competition will
            typically be donated to the designated charity (or such other percentage as stated on the contest page).
            If the designated charity is unable or unwilling to accept the donation, the Host may donate the
            charity portion to an alternate charity of similar mission in its reasonable discretion.
          </p>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            Purchased votes are not tax-deductible charitable contributions and you will not receive a
            written acknowledgement for tax purposes.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section style={styles.section}>
          <h2 style={styles.h2}>8. Winner Verification and Prize Claim</h2>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            All potential winners are subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with these Contest
            Terms. Winners may be required to execute and return an Affidavit of Eligibility, Liability Release, and
            (where lawful) Publicity Release ("Prize Claim Documents"), and to provide a completed IRS Form W-9 (or
            other tax forms required by law). A potential winner may be disqualified and an alternate winner
            selected if:
          </p>
          <ul style={styles.ul}>
            <li style={styles.li}>the Host is unable to verify the potential winner's eligibility or identity;</li>
            <li style={styles.li}>the potential winner fails to respond to a winner notification within five (5) days;</li>
            <li style={styles.li}>the potential winner declines the prize or fails to complete the Prize Claim Documents within the period requested;</li>
            <li style={styles.li}>the potential winner is a Canadian resident and fails to correctly answer the mathematical skill-testing question described below; or</li>
            <li style={styles.li}>the potential winner is found to have violated these Contest Terms, the Terms of Use, or applicable law.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style={styles.p}>
            <span style={styles.strong}>Skill-testing question (Canadian residents).</span> To comply with Canadian
            law, any potential winner who is a resident of Canada must, before any prize is awarded, correctly answer
            without mechanical or other aid a time-limited mathematical skill-testing question administered by the
            Host. The question will involve at least three arithmetic operations (such as addition, subtraction,
            multiplication, and division). The potential winner has one (1) attempt and must respond within the time
            specified by the Host at the time the question is presented. Failure to correctly answer the
            skill-testing question within the time allowed will result in disqualification and the selection of an
            alternate winner, who will be subject to the same requirement.
