/**
 * Auto-generated, per-competition Official Rules.
 *
 * Where `competitionRules.buildAutoRules` produces the short at-a-glance
 * accordion (a handful of blurbs), this builds the *complete* Official Rules
 * document for a single competition — the long-form page a host can point
 * entrants, voters, and sponsors at (cf. a magazine cover competition's
 * `/rules` page).
 *
 * Everything here is derived from the competition's own configuration, so the
 * document always states the *actual* operator, eligibility, schedule, scoring,
 * judging, prizes, and charity for that competition and can never drift from
 * how it is set up. Boilerplate that is identical across every competition
 * references the platform-wide Contest Terms, Terms of Use, and Privacy Policy
 * rather than being duplicated here.
 *
 * Framing note: EliteRank competitions are structured as a **contest of skill**,
 * not a sweepstakes. This generator deliberately avoids sweepstakes / AMOE
 * language and instead emphasizes that entry is free and that paid votes only
 * add voting capacity — the load-bearing facts for that posture. If a
 * voter-drawing feature is ever added, this framing must be revisited.
 *
 * Tolerant of both the dashboard's camelCase competition object and the public
 * page's raw snake_case row, so a single generator serves both.
 *
 * Returns `{ sections: [{ id, title, blocks }] }`, where each block is one of:
 *   { kind: 'p', text }            — a paragraph
 *   { kind: 'callout', text }      — an emphasized callout box
 *   { kind: 'ul', items: [] }      — a bullet list
 *   { kind: 'policyLinks' }        — renders the standard related-policy links
 *   { kind: 'contact' }            — renders the operator contact box
 *
 * Section numbers are assigned from array order at the end, so inserting or
 * omitting a conditional section (judging, voting, charity) can never desync
 * the numbering.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * FUTURE COMPETITION STYLES — rules work pending (noted, not yet built):
 *
 * 1. PURE-JUDGE competitions with a CONTESTANT ENTRY FEE (paid on acceptance).
 *    Decided product direction: purely judge-based competitions will charge an
 *    entry fee, paid by the contestant when their entry is accepted. NOT built
 *    yet (no entry_fee field; `create-payment-intent` is vote-only). When it
 *    ships, the "no cost to enter" assertions in THIS file (see the "How to
 *    Enter" and "No Purchase Necessary" sections below) become FALSE for those
 *    competitions and must be made conditional on the fee — the rules must
 *    state the entry fee, when it is charged (on acceptance), and that it is
 *    non-refundable / refundable per policy. The same hard-coded "no cost to
 *    enter" line lives in `competitionRules.buildAutoRules`.
 *      ⚠️ Lottery analysis (issue #531) MUST be redone first: a contestant
 *      entry fee introduces "consideration." Pure-judge = judges' weight 100%,
 *      which lands in the SAFE "skill-dominant contest of skill" quadrant of
 *      #531's matrix (paid entry + judges ≥ 50%), but it must be gated so a
 *      paid-entry competition can never launch with judges' weight < 50%, and
 *      the contest-of-skill framing in ContestTermsPage must be reconciled.
 *
 * 2. PURE VOTE-BASED competitions (selection_criteria === 'votes', no judging).
 *    A first-class, supported style: winners decided entirely by public vote —
 *    the model magazine "cover" competitions use (e.g. Inked). The `else`
 *    branch of "How Winners Are Chosen" plus the Voting section ARE the rules
 *    for this style; keep them accurate so the document is correct for every
 *    pure-vote competition.
