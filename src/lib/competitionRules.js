/**
 * Auto-generated competition rules.
 *
 * Rules used to be free-text sections a host typed in by hand. They're now
 * derived automatically from the competition's own configuration, so the public
 * page always states the *actual* mechanics (selection process, eligibility,
 * entry, voting, charity) and can never drift from how the competition is set
 * up. Pure function — used by both the host dashboard preview (Site tab) and
 * the public competition page, so the two always match.
 *
 * Tolerant of both the dashboard's camelCase competition object and the public
 * page's raw snake_case row, so a single generator serves both.
 *
 * Returns an array of `{ title, content }` sections. Sections with nothing
 * meaningful to say are omitted.
