/**
 * Public-safe (anon-readable) column lists for `profiles` and `organizations`.
 *
 * The anonymous Supabase key has had its table-wide SELECT on these tables
 * revoked and re-granted at the COLUMN level — see
 *   supabase/migrations/20260628120000_103_restrict_anon_pii_columns.sql
 *
 * Because of that, the anon key cannot SELECT *or filter on* any column outside
 * these lists. Every anonymous-reachable query (direct, embedded, or via a
 * cached-query helper) must use these instead of `'*'`, or it will fail with
 * `permission denied for column …` for logged-out visitors.
 *
 * KEEP THESE IN SYNC WITH THE GRANTs IN MIGRATION 103. Authenticated users keep
 * full column access, so authenticated-only queries may still use `'*'`.
 *
 * Excluded from PROFILE_PUBLIC_COLS: email, phone, shipping_address,
 *   onesignal_external_id, notification_preferences, bonus_actions, is_super_admin
 * Excluded from ORG_PUBLIC_COLS: stripe_connect_account_id, kyc_status,
